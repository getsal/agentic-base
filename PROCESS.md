## Overview

Our development process follows a structured, seven-phase approach:

1. **Phase 1: Planning** → Product Requirements Document (PRD)
2. **Phase 2: Architecture** → Software Design Document (SDD)
3. **Phase 3: Sprint Planning** → Sprint Plan
4. **Phase 4: Implementation** → Production Code with Feedback Loop
5. **Phase 5: Review** → Quality Validation and Sprint Approval
6. **Phase 5.5: Sprint Security Audit** → Security Review and Approval
7. **Phase 6: Deployment** → Production Infrastructure and Handover

Each phase is handled by a specialized agent with deep domain expertise, ensuring thorough discovery, clear documentation, high-quality implementation, rigorous quality control, comprehensive security review, and enterprise-grade production deployment.

## Agent-to-Agent Communication

The framework uses three feedback loops for quality assurance:

### 1. Implementation Feedback Loop (Phases 4-5)

#### **Engineer → Senior Lead** (`docs/a2a/reviewer.md`)

The engineer generates a comprehensive report after implementation:
- What was accomplished
- Files created/modified
- Test coverage
- Technical decisions
- Verification steps
- Feedback addressed (if revision)

#### **Senior Lead → Engineer** (`docs/a2a/engineer-feedback.md`)

The senior technical lead reviews and provides feedback:
- Issues found
- Required changes
- Clarifications needed
- Quality concerns
- Approval status ("All good" when approved)

The engineer reads this file on the next `/implement {sprint}` invocation, clarifies anything unclear, fixes all issues, and generates an updated report.

### 2. Sprint Security Feedback Loop (Phase 5.5)

#### **Engineer → Security Auditor** (`docs/a2a/reviewer.md` + implemented code)

After senior lead approval, the security auditor reviews:
- Implementation report context
- Actual code files (security-focused review)
- Security requirements from PRD/SDD

#### **Security Auditor → Engineer** (`docs/a2a/auditor-sprint-feedback.md`)

The security auditor provides security-focused feedback:
- Security vulnerabilities (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Affected files with line numbers
- Exploit scenarios and security impact
- Specific remediation guidance
- Approval status ("APPROVED - LETS FUCKING GO" when secure)

The engineer reads this file with HIGHEST PRIORITY on the next `/implement {sprint}` invocation, addresses ALL CRITICAL and HIGH security issues, and generates an updated report with security fixes documented.

## Multi-Developer Usage Warning

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: This framework is architected for **single-threaded workflows**. The agent system assumes one active development stream at a time.

### Why Multi-Developer Concurrent Usage Breaks

If multiple developers use `/implement` simultaneously:

1. **A2A File Collisions**: Reports overwritten before review
2. **Sprint Status Conflicts**: Merge conflicts on task completion
3. **Context Confusion**: Mixed implementation context
4. **Broken Feedback Loops**: Feedback intended for wrong engineer

### Solutions for Team Collaboration

#### Option 1: Developer-Scoped A2A
```
docs/a2a/
├── alice/
│   ├── reviewer.md
│   └── engineer-feedback.md
├── bob/
│   ├── reviewer.md
│   └── engineer-feedback.md
```

#### Option 2: Task-Scoped Reports
```
docs/a2a/
├── sprint-1-task-1/
│   ├── implementation-report.md
│   └── review-feedback.md
├── sprint-1-task-2/
│   ├── implementation-report.md
│   └── review-feedback.md
```

#### Option 3: External System Integration
- Use Linear/GitHub Issues for task assignment
- Conduct A2A communication in issue comments
- Coordinate sprint.md updates through PR reviews

#### Option 4: Feature Branches
- Each developer works on feature branch with own docs snapshot
- A2A communication in branch-specific files
- Consolidate on merge

---

## Best Practices

### For All Phases

1. **Answer Thoroughly**: Agents ask questions for a reason
2. **Clarify Early**: If unclear, ask agents to rephrase
3. **Review Outputs**: Always review generated documents
4. **Iterate Freely**: Use the feedback loop for improvement

### For Implementation

- **Provide Clear Feedback**: Be specific in feedback files
- **Use File References**: Include file paths and line numbers
- **Explain Why**: Don't just say "fix this"—explain reasoning
- **Test Before Approving**: Run verification steps from report

### For DevOps & Infrastructure

- Security first—never compromise on fundamentals
- Automate everything that can be automated
- Design for failure—everything will eventually fail
- Monitor before deploying—can't fix what you can't see
- Document runbooks and incident response procedures

---

## Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Define product requirements
/plan-and-analyze
# → Answer discovery questions
# → Review docs/prd.md

# 2. Design architecture
/architect

# 3. Plan sprints
/sprint-plan
# → Clarify capacity and priorities
# → Review docs/sprint.md

# 4. Implement Sprint 1
/implement sprint-1

# → Re-review until "All good"

# 7. Security audit Sprint 1 (after approval)
/audit-sprint
# → Either "APPROVED - LETS FUCKING GO" or "CHANGES_REQUIRED"

# 8. Address security feedback (if needed)
/implement sprint-1
# → Fix security issues
# → Re-audit until approved

# 9. Continue with remaining sprints...
# → Each sprint goes through: implement → review → audit → approve

# 10. Full codebase security audit (before production)
/audit
# → Fix any critical issues

# 11. Deploy to production
/deploy-production
# → Production infrastructure deployed
```
